        <h2>Recommended Exercises for Hypertrophy</h2>
        <p>To maximize hypertrophy, itâ€™s essential to choose exercises that efficiently target each muscle group while allowing for progressive overload. Below is a list of key exercises by muscle group, along with tips on proper form for optimal muscle activation.</p>
        
        <h3>Chest</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bench Press:</strong> Engage your chest by lowering the barbell slowly to your chest and pushing back up. Aim for 8-12 reps per set.</li>
            <li><strong>Dumbbell Fly:</strong> Maintain a slight bend in your elbows as you lower the dumbbells, focusing on a stretch in the chest muscles.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Back</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pull-Ups:</strong> Use a shoulder-width grip to target the lats. Focus on pulling through your elbows to engage the back effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Rows (Cable or Dumbbell):</strong> Keep your back straight and pull the weight to your lower chest, engaging the mid-back muscles.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Legs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Squats:</strong> Keep your core tight and descend until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Use a controlled motion for maximum muscle activation.</li>
            <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Take a step forward and lower your back knee, ensuring that your front knee stays above your ankle.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Shoulders</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shoulder Press:</strong> Keep the weights aligned with your shoulders, pressing upwards without locking your elbows.</li>
            <li><strong>Lateral Raise:</strong> Raise dumbbells out to your sides with a slight bend in the elbows, focusing on the middle deltoids.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Arms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bicep Curls:</strong> Keep your elbows close to your body and avoid swinging. Squeeze at the top of the curl.</li>
            <li><strong>Tricep Extensions:</strong> Extend fully to target the triceps, keeping your elbows close to your head.</li>
        </ul>
