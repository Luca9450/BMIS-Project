        <h2>What is Hypertrophy Training?</h2>
        <p>Hypertrophy training is the process of increasing muscle size by inducing muscle fiber growth through targeted resistance training. It's ideal for those looking to gain muscle mass and improve muscle definition. Unlike strength training, which emphasizes maximal lifting capacity, hypertrophy training focuses on controlled, repetitive movements that cause micro-tears in muscle fibers, which heal and rebuild bigger and stronger.</p>

        <h3>Key Hypertrophy Training Principles</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Method</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Progressive Overload</td>
                <td>Gradually increasing weight, reps, or intensity over time to continuously challenge muscles.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Volume Training</td>
                <td>High sets and reps per muscle group to maximize muscle fiber recruitment and fatigue.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rest-Pause</td>
                <td>Short rest intervals of 10-15 seconds to push muscles to their limits, enhancing growth stimulus.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mind-Muscle Connection</td>
                <td>Focusing on the target muscle during each exercise to improve activation and effectiveness.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Controlled Eccentric Movements</td>
                <td>Focusing on the "lowering" phase of movements to increase muscle tension and breakdown.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Incorporating these principles strategically can yield significant muscle growth while reducing the risk of injury. Hypertrophy training also emphasizes a balanced approach, targeting all major muscle groups to prevent imbalances.</p>
